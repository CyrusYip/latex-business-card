# LaTeX Business Card

A simple template for a business card with LaTeX. This setup creates one card (rather than a grid of cards on letter paper), for submission to professional printing service. 

Paper size is of common dimension (at least in the US?) but is customizable, as is the margin size.

The image used in my card is an illustration (of me!) by Shayenna Telles.

## About fonts

This document uses the FontAwesome package for LaTeX, which works best with pdfLaTeX. This means limited type families are available by default. You could set the document up for XeLaTeX, but the user would need to do additional work to make the FontAwesome library available to XeLaTeX as a font. See [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/132888/fontawesome-font-not-found) or [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30677698/xelatex-fontawesome).

I use Minion Pro in my work, but Minion Pro is a pain to set up for pdfLaTeX. I did it with the help of some combination of Kieran Healy's [blog post](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/11/10/installing-minion-pro/)  about this and Sebastian Schubert's [FontPro](https://github.com/sebschub/FontPro) scripts.




# Other Business Card Templates

I have the vague feeling that I borrowed a lot of this card design from somewhere...but I can't remember where. I'm sorry.

However, if you would like to investigate other business card templates, see
